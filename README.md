# KakaoMapCrawler

This crawler parses the names of locations and addresses of cross roads in Seoul (서울 교차로) from Kakao Map (map.kakao.com)

The keyword can be changed to any other locations you want and it will work fine.

The output will be stored at the same directory of the source code named "street.txt"
